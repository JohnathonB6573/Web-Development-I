<h1>Johnathon Brumfield</h1>
<h2>Junior Computer Science Student</h2>
<p>Hello my name is Johnathon Brumfield, I am a junior at Mizzou. I like to hang out with friends, make money, and play basketball. I am from Branson, MO. I chose computer science as my major because it will allow me to pay back my debt fast after college. The most recent movie I have watched is The Internship.</p>
